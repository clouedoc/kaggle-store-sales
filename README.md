## Evaluation

> The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error.

---> note: I didn't get an answer from the Julia Community forum, so I guess that the reason why I get NaN is that my model is just too bad... Which means I should be able to start feature engineering and see if the basic (non logarithmic) RMSE improves.
